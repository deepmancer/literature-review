    \begin{itemize}
        \item Proposed \emph{HairStep}, a novel intermediate representation combining strand maps and depth maps for 3D hair reconstruction.
        \item Developed a weakly-supervised domain adaptation method for depth estimation using synthetic priors and real-world sparse annotations.
        \item Created \emph{HiSa} (strand annotations) and \emph{HiDa} (relative depth annotations) datasets for 1,250 real portrait images.
        \item Introduced new metrics, \emph{HairSale} (strand alignment error) and \emph{HairRida} (relative depth accuracy), for quantitative evaluation of 3D hair modeling.
        \item Achieved state-of-the-art performance in single-view 3D hair modeling.
    \end{itemize}
