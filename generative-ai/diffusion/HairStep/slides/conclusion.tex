    \textbf{Contributions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Proposed \emph{HairStep}, a novel intermediate representation combining strand and depth maps.
        \item Collected new datasets \emph{HiSa} and \emph{HiDa} with annotated real images.
        \item Proposed two quantitative metrics: \emph{HairSale} and \emph{HairRida}.
        \item Achieved state-of-the-art performance in single-view 3D hair modeling.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Limitations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Manual annotation is time-consuming, limiting scalability.
        \item Generalization to unseen hairstyles and diverse real-world conditions needs further investigation.
    \end{itemize}
